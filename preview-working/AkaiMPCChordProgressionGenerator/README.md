# Chord Progression Generator - piano, guitar tabs, Akai MPC

**Create musically intelligent chord progressions and view them as piano keyboard, guitar tabs, or staff notation.**

Instead of trawling through chord books or generic MIDI packs, generate custom progressions tailored to your needs. Print chord sheets to jam with your band, export MIDI files for your DAW, or export `.progression` files for Akai MPC Pad Perform.

## Two Approaches, One Ecosystem

While the [MPC Chord Progression Finder](https://github.com/liotier/AkaiMPC/blob/main/AkaiMPCChordProgressionFinder/README.md) helps you identify and recreate chord progressions from existing music, this Generator takes the opposite approach: **it creates new progressions from scratch based on music theory principles**.

## For Crate Diggers and Beat Makers

### Chord Matcher: Bridge Your Samples to Theory
Found a sample with killer chords but don't know the key? The Chord Matcher lets you:
- Input the chords you've identified from your sample
- Get instant suggestions for compatible keys and modes for **both** Progression Palette and Scale modes
- Generate complementary progressions that work with your source material
- Bridge the gap between sample-based and theory-based production

### Two Workflows for Every Creative Process
- **Progression Palette Mode** - Choose from 133 progression palettes across 15 genres (Pop/Rock, Jazz, Blues, Gospel, Hip-Hop/Trap, Latin, Trance, Jungle/DnB, and more). 60+ progressions feature **genre-specific palette intelligence** that prioritizes authentic chord voicings for each style. Generate four voicing variants instantly.
- **Scale Mode** - Pick from 36 scales/modes and explore all available chords. Perfect for learning exotic scales like Whole Tone, Maqam Hijaz, or Phrygian Dominant.
- Download individual variants or bulk export all four versions at once

## Musical Intelligence Under the Hood

### Four Intelligent Variants, Four Different Vibes

Each generation creates four musically distinct versions of your progression with optimized voice leading:

- **Classic** - Default voice leading optimization for smooth transitions with minimal finger movement.
- **Jazz** - Close voicings for that tight, sophisticated sound. Extended chords (7ths, 9ths) where appropriate.
- **Modal** - Open voicings (drop-2) for a more spacious, airy sound. Perfect for atmospheric pads.
- **Experimental** - Spread voicings for maximum variation. For producers who color outside the lines.

### Chord Palette Approach: Your Musical Color Wheel

Rather than repeating chords sequentially, each progression provides a **palette of 16 unique chords** - like a painter's color palette for harmonic exploration:

- **All 16 pads are unique** - No duplicate chord types, maximizing your harmonic options
- **Genre-specific palette intelligence** - 60+ progressions now feature smart priority weighting: preferred chord voicings appear first (Blues loves dom7, Folk prefers simple triads, Gospel embraces major7). Chords are sorted by musical authenticity for each style.
- **Harmonic gradient from foundation to spice** - Bottom row (pads 1-4) provides bread-and-butter chords with the tonic anchoring pad 1. Top row (pads 13-16) offers adventurous, colorful extensions for when you want to take risks.
- **Intelligent extensions** - For each chord degree, generates different variations (triads, 7ths, major 7ths, 9ths) plus complementary chords (ii7, vi, ♭VII, ♭VI, ♭III, iv)
- **Your sequence, your choice** - The generator gives you the colors; you paint the progression

## Deep Music Theory, Simple Interface

### Comprehensive Scale Support
36 scales organized into 6 categories - from the familiar to the exotic:
- **Common Western Tonal**: Major, Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Locrian, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor
- **Compact/Popular**: Pentatonic Major/Minor, Blues scale
- **Symmetrical/Jazz**: Whole Tone, Diminished scales, Augmented
- **Arabic Maqamat**: Hijaz, Bayati, Rast, Saba, Kurd
- **Indian Ragas**: Bhairav, Kafi, Yaman, Bhairavi, Todi
- **Exotic**: Double Harmonic, Hungarian Minor, Neapolitan Major/Minor, Enigmatic, Phrygian Dominant, Persian, Hirajoshi, Insen, Kumoi, Egyptian Pentatonic

### Advanced Harmonic Concepts Made Easy
The generator seamlessly incorporates:
- **Borrowed Chords** - Automatic modal interchange (that ♭VII from Mixolydian, iv from minor)
- **Secondary Dominants** - V/V, V/ii, V/vi for that gospel/jazz movement
- **Neapolitan & Augmented Sixths** - Classical drama when you need it
- **Tritone Substitutions** - Jazz reharmonization at the click of a button

### Battle-Tested Progression Palettes
133 progression palettes across 15 genres covering every style. **60+ progressions feature genre-specific palette intelligence** that prioritizes musically authentic chord voicings:
- **Pop/Rock**: I-V-vi-IV (the "four chord song"), vi-IV-I-V (pop-punk anthem), classic rock patterns
- **Blues/Soul**: 12-bar blues, turnarounds, Dorian vamps, minor blues (smart palettes prefer dom7, major; avoid experimental voicings)
- **Jazz/Functional**: ii-V-I, Rhythm Changes, Giant Steps cycle, circle progressions
- **Classical/Modal**: Circle of Fifths, Andalusian Cadence, Pachelbel's Canon, Passamezzo patterns
- **Electronic/Modern**: EDM drops, dark house, modal interchange, chromatic mediant (Techno prefers minimal harmony)
- **R&B/Neo-Soul**: Extended harmony, chromatic soul, emotional ballads (smart palettes embrace major7, minor7, dom7)
- **Gospel/Worship**: Gospel turnarounds, praise progressions, secondary dominants (loves major7, dom7)
- **Hip-Hop/Trap**: Trap minor, dark trap, lofi hip-hop, boom bap, emo rap (prefers simple minor/major, minimal complexity)
- **Latin/Bossa**: Bossa nova, tango, samba, flamenco, bolero (embraces minor7, major7, dom7)
- **Film/Cinematic**: Epic trailer progressions, dark cinematic, heroic themes
- **Folk/Singer-Songwriter**: Folk standards, country, Americana, Irish folk (simple triads preferred; avoids jazz complexity)
- **Metal/Rock**: Power metal, doom metal, prog metal, melodic metal (power chords preferred; avoids jazz extensions)
- **Trance/Psytrance/Goa**: Classic Goa, dark psy, uplifting trance, phrygian trance (modal simplicity with hypnotic character)
- **Jungle/Drum'n'Bass**: Dark jungle, liquid DnB, neurofunk, jazzstep
- **Synthwave/Retrowave**: Outrun, darkwave, cyberpunk (80s-style major/minor with selective 7th usage)
- **Reggae/Dub, UK Bass, Italo-Disco/House, African Dance, Acid/EBM**: Genre-specific progressions with smart palette priorities

### Dynamic Row 4: Your Secret Weapon
The fourth row isn't just filler—it's dynamically calculated based on sophisticated harmonic analysis:

- **Harmonic Function Analysis** - Identifies what your progression needs: missing tonic resolution? Need more tension? The algorithm knows.
- **Voice Leading Optimization** - Selects chords that create the smoothest transitions with minimal finger movement
- **Context-Aware Suggestions** - Adds borrowed chords, secondary dominants, and modal interchange based on your selected style
- **Genre Intelligence with Palette Priorities** - 60+ progressions use a sophisticated 3-tier weighting system (preferred, allowed, avoided) to prioritize genre-authentic chord voicings. Blues gets dom7, Folk gets simple triads, Gospel gets extended harmony—automatically.

Note about repository layout
---------------------------------
This project was originally distributed as a single self-contained HTML file for maximum deployment simplicity. It has since been split into modular ES6 files for better maintainability:

- `index.html` (was AkaiMPCChordProgressionGenerator.html) — the entry HTML
- `styles.css` — extracted stylesheet
- `app.js` — main application logic
- `modules/musicTheory.js` — core music theory engine
- `modules/guitarChords.js` — guitar chord library
- `modules/storage.js` — localStorage and URL handling
- `modules/rendering.js` — SVG generation for keyboard, guitar, and staff notation diagrams

Deployment remains the same: host these files on any static file host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.). Modular structure improves readability, caching, and makes incremental development and testing easier.
