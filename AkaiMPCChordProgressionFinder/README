## üéπ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Pure Interval-Based Analysis**: Analyzes chords from actual MIDI note data, not relying on potentially incorrect chord names
- **Smart Key Detection**: Automatically detects the root note and scale/mode of each progression
- **Roman Numeral Analysis**: Shows chord functions within the detected key using simplified notation (I, ii, iii, IV, etc.)
- **Playable Progressions Detection**: Instantly see which famous progressions (ii-V-I, I-V-vi-IV, etc.) you can play with each chord set

### User Interface
- **4x4 MPC Pad Layout**: Visualizes chords exactly as they appear on your MPC hardware
- **Interactive Playback**: Click any pad to hear the chord, or play the entire progression
- **Drag & Drop Loading**: Simply drop your `.progression` files onto the page
- **Real-time Filtering**: Filter by key, scale, playable progressions, or specific chords

### Musical Coverage
- **Jazz Standards**: ii-V-I, I-vi-ii-V, Rhythm Changes, and more
- **Pop/Rock**: I-V-vi-IV, 50s progression, and other popular patterns  
- **Blues**: 12-bar blues, minor blues, and variations
- **Classical/Folk**: Authentic and plagal cadences

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Online Version

### Local Usage
1. Download the HTML file
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Drop your `.progression` files onto the page
4. Start exploring your chord sets!

## üìÅ File Format

The tool reads Akai MPC `.progression` files (JSON format) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "progression": {
    "name": "Jazz Standards C Major",
    "chords": [
      {
        "name": "Cmaj7",
        "notes": [60, 64, 67, 71]
      },
      {
        "name": "Dm7",
        "notes": [62, 65, 69, 72]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: The tool analyzes the actual MIDI note numbers, not the chord names, ensuring accurate analysis even if chords are mislabeled.
