## Two Approaches, One Ecosystem

While the [MPC Chord Progression Finder](https://github.com/liotier/AkaiMPC/blob/main/AkaiMPCChordProgressionFinder/README.md) helps you identify and recreate chord progressions from existing music, this Generator takes the opposite approach: **it creates new progressions from scratch based on music theory principles**.

## For Crate Diggers and Beat Makers

### Chord Matcher: Bridge Your Samples to Theory
Found a sample with killer chords but don't know the key? The Chord Matcher lets you:
- Input the chords you've identified from your sample
- Get instant suggestions for compatible keys and modes
- Generate complementary progressions that work with your source material
- Bridge the gap between sample-based and theory-based production

### Instant Inspiration
- **"I'm clueless but reasonable"** - Generates safe, proven progressions in common keys (think Billboard Top 100 ready)
- **"I'm feeling lucky"** - Explores exotic scales and advanced harmony (for when you want to sound like nobody else)
- Download individual variants or bulk export all four versions at once

## Musical Intelligence Under the Hood

### Dynamic Row 4: Your Secret Weapon
The fourth row isn't just filler‚Äîit's dynamically calculated based on sophisticated harmonic analysis:

- **Harmonic Function Analysis** - Identifies what your progression needs: missing tonic resolution? Need more tension? The algorithm knows.
- **Voice Leading Optimization** - Selects chords that create the smoothest transitions with minimal finger movement
- **Context-Aware Suggestions** - Adds borrowed chords, secondary dominants, and modal interchange based on your selected style
- **Genre Intelligence** - Hip-hop? Adds that ‚ô≠VII. Jazz? Throws in a ii-V. Neo-soul? Extended harmony all day.

### Four Intelligent Variants, Four Different Vibes

Each generation creates four musically distinct versions of your progression:

- **Classic** - Radio-ready progressions with just enough spice. Perfect for pop, rock, and R&B.
- **Jazz** - Extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths), altered dominants, and smooth voice leading. Think Robert Glasper meets your MPC.
- **Modal** - Explores the unique colors of each mode. Dorian ‚ôÆ6, Lydian #4, Mixolydian ‚ô≠7‚Äîall the flavors.
- **Experimental** - Unconventional voicings, quartal harmony, and unexpected substitutions. For producers who color outside the lines.

## Deep Music Theory, Simple Interface

### Comprehensive Scale Support
From the familiar to the exotic, we've got you covered:
- **Foundation**: Major, Natural/Harmonic/Melodic Minor, all seven Church Modes
- **Blues & Soul**: Pentatonic scales, Blues scale with proper ‚ô≠5
- **World Music**: Persian, Japanese, Hungarian Minor, Double Harmonic, and more
- **Jazz Extensions**: Bebop scales, Altered scale, Whole Tone

### Advanced Harmonic Concepts Made Easy
The generator seamlessly incorporates:
- **Borrowed Chords** - Automatic modal interchange (that ‚ô≠VII from Mixolydian, iv from minor)
- **Secondary Dominants** - V/V, V/ii, V/vi for that gospel/jazz movement
- **Neapolitan & Augmented Sixths** - Classical drama when you need it
- **Tritone Substitutions** - Jazz reharmonization at the click of a button

### Battle-Tested Progression Templates
Covering every genre and era:
- **Modern Pop**: I-V-vi-IV (the "four chord song"), vi-IV-I-V (pop-punk anthem)
- **Jazz Standards**: ii-V-I in all keys, Rhythm Changes, Giant Steps cycle
- **Blues Forms**: 12-bar blues, 8-bar blues, minor blues with proper substitutions
- **Classical**: Circle of Fifths, Andalusian Cadence, Pachelbel's Canon sequence
- **Electronic**: EDM build progressions, Future Bass sequences, Lo-fi hip-hop loops

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
- Report bugs or suggest features via GitHub Issues
- Submit pull requests with improvements
- Share your `.progression` files for testing

Note about repository layout
---------------------------------
This project was originally distributed as a single self-contained HTML file for maximum deployment simplicity. It has since been split into three static files for better maintainability:

- `AkaiMPCChordProgressionGenerator.html` ‚Äî the entry HTML (loads the CSS and JS)
- `styles.css` ‚Äî extracted stylesheet
- `app.js` ‚Äî main JavaScript logic

Deployment remains the same: host these files on any static file host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.). Keeping them separate improves readability, caching, and makes incremental development and testing easier.
